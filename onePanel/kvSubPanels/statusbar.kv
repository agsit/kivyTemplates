# Decription:
#   This is layout use for a typical status update at the bottom of the UI window to let user know
#   the latest state of the software.
#
# create a new Kivy class "StatusBar" based on BoxLayout.
# Note: Kivy classes MUST start with a capital.
<StatusBar@BoxLayout>:
  # Define properties that can be accessed directly in python instead of using the Kivy "ids"
  # dictionary to access the various widgets properties. This adds a little bit of overhead
  # here since the Python properties have to be defined, but it also makes for slightly
  # cleaner coding since the property "ids" does not have to be called all over the place (this
  # is not really beneficial if there is only a single Kivy panel/class in the App, but it can
  # be quite beneficial when you have multiple levels of sub-panels/classes)
