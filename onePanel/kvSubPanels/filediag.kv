<FileDiag@BoxLayout>:
  # Define properties that can be accessed directly in python instead of using the Kivy "ids"
  # dictionary to access the various widgets properties. This adds a little bit of overhead
  # here since the Python properties have to be defined, but it also makes for slightly
  # cleaner coding on the Python side since the property "ids" does not have to be called all over
  # the place (this is not really beneficial if there is only a single Kivy panel in the App, but
  # it can be quite beneficial when there are multiple levels of sub-panels/classes)
