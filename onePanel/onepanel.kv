# Decription:
#   This is the "main" layout the GUI window.
#
# create a new Kivy class "OnePanelgui" based on GridLayout, see Python class definition.
# Note: Kivy classes MUST start with a capital and for this "main" class the name must match
#       exactly with the Python class name used to define the GUI
<OnePanelGui>:
  # In this case, the main window is separated in three rows using a GridLayout.  Each row uses
  # a custom Kivy class that is defined in separate *.kv files. The two mains motivations to 
  # define these classes in their own *.kv files are 1) re-usability or modularity and 2) keeping
  # the file size/length smaller. For example the "FileDiag.kv" and "StatusBar.kv" can easily be 
  # re-used in various applications 
  rows: 3
  # Define properties that can be accessed directly in python instead of using the Kivy "ids"
  # dictionary to access the various widgets properties. This adds a little bit of overhead
  # here since the Python properties have to be defined, but it also makes for slightly
  # cleaner coding on the Python side since the property "ids" does not have to be called all over
  # the place (this is not really beneficial if there is only a single Kivy panel in the App, but
  # it can be quite beneficial when there are multiple levels of sub-panels/classes)
  #
  # Define properties that can be accessed in Python using "self.root.<property name>"
  fileDiag: kvLytFileDiag   # This links the Python property to the Kivy id
  statusBar: kvLytStatusBar # This links the Python property to the Kivy id
  # Instantiate a custom Kivy class that is defined in the "filediag.kv" file sub-panel
  FileDiag:
    id: kvLytFileDiag
  # Instantiate a Kivy BoxLayout class

    size_hint_y: 1
  # Instantiate a custom Kivy class that is defined in the "status.kv" file sub-panel
  StatusBar:
